# Task-Dependence-Ontology

This repository contains the formal model accompanying the KEOD 2023 regular paper submission titled "Towards an Ontology of Task Dependence in Organizations." While also available elsewhere, the model is presented in this repository for the purpose of maintaining the anonymity of the authors.

Four files are contained in this repo:
- ```Task_Dependence_Ontology.pdf```: Presents the formal model in first-order logic, accompanied by English descriptions of each axiom. The conceptual model is also included here again for clarity. A brief discussion on the validation of the model is also included.
- ```tdo_axioms.in```: Encoding of the entire axiomatization for usage in Prover9/Mace4.
- ```tdo_instance.in```: Encoding of the scenarios captured in the Application section of the paper, for the purposes of model validation. Instance assertions are at the bottom of the file, appended to the axiomatization file.
- ```paper_submission.pdf```: A copy of the submitted paper.
